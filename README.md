ABOUT AFRICOIN AFC

Africoin is a global alternative currency

Africoin (AFC) is a decentralized digital currency. AFC is a global alternative currency to fiat. AFC is a peer-to-peer (P2P) version of electronic cash that allows online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.

We Are De-centralized

Cryptography and the de-centralized nature of AFC is the key to Africoin’s success. It’s the reason that no one can double spend, counterfeit or steal AFC. Africoin is to be viable money for both current users and future adopters so we will maintain, improve and legally protect the integrity of the protocol to ensure this. You only have to look at the global banking crisis 2008 to see what can happen when centralized control takes over!

AFC is controlled by you!

The AFC network is configured so that no one central point has control, it's controlled by the entire AFC community always checking each other’s work to ensure no-one is corrupting the block chain. This provides intrinsic security for the network. AFC has a total coin count of 50million coins. What sets AFC aside from other crypto-currencies is its drive to become the major means of digital exchange in Africa and also other parts of the world.

Africoin's global distribution

With our current growing global distribution, super-fast transaction times, and circulation volume this gives us a market edge. The distribution of AFC is one of the reasons AFC remains so strong.
